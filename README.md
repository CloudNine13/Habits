# Habits
This is a repository of a project that I made studying Kotlin and Android technologies. It's a simple application where you can make your own habits. 
In this project I studying using Android APIs (e.g. SQLite), higher-order extension funcions etc. Also I'm trying to follow good practices to write clean, understandable, good code.
